`hx-confirm` in HTMX is a directive that displays a browser's native confirmation dialog before executing an action. When you add `hx-confirm` to an element, it will show a popup asking the user to confirm their action before the HTMX request is sent.

Here's an example:

```html
<button hx-delete="/user/123" 
        hx-confirm="Are you sure you want to delete this user?">
    Delete User
</button>
```

When a user clicks this button, a browser confirmation dialog will appear with:
- The message you specified
- "OK" and "Cancel" buttons
- If the user clicks "Cancel", the HTMX request will be prevented
- If the user clicks "OK", the request will proceed

Key points about `hx-confirm`:
- Uses the browser's native confirmation dialog
- Works with any HTMX request type (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.)
- Provides a simple way to add a confirmation step to potentially destructive actions
- The confirmation message can be dynamically generated
- Does not require any additional JavaScript

It's a simple but effective way to prevent accidental actions and improve user experience by adding a confirmation step.
